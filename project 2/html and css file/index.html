           HTML is a language. It has its own words (tags) and rules for 
           how those words can be put togehter.

       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           HTML Markup is made up of <b>tags</b>. These tags
           tell the computer <em>how</em> to display the text. A tag 
           <em>usually</em> consists of both an opening and a closing tag,
           with the contents in between, and the entire entity is
           referred to as an <b>element</b>. Some tags, like the 
           image tag, do not contain any text content to be displayed 
           and therefore do not have an end tag. 
           A tag can have none, one, or multiple
           <b>attributes</b> inside of it. <a href = "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">

           HTML elements can be either inline, or block. Block elements 
           form an invisible box around the contents inside of them. 
           This box can be adjusted in both height and width. Inline 
           elements simply appear in line with the text.

         The "Tree-Like" Structure of HTML
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           The DOM (<b>D</b>ocument <b>O</b>bject <b>M</b>odel) refers 
           to the tree-like structure of a webpage. This tree-like, or 
           branching structure is formed because HTML can have one tag 
           nested inside another tag nested inside another tag and so on. 
           When viewed with developer tools in a browser, this structure 
           can be seen by expanding the triangle at the beginning of 
           the first element (the html tag) and continuing to expand 
           each tag until there is nothing left but text. What this triangle really represents though, is a box. You can think 
           of a well structured webpage kind of like one of those pretty 
           nesting dolls; but instead of the containers being doll shaped, 
           the containers are box shaped. There is one big doll, or box 
           (the html tag) and it contains all the other boxes, 
           or elements, neatly boxed away inside of it.

         <p>
           Everything on the web is made up of boxes. Even circles 
           are boxes; they have just been styled, using CSS, to <em>look</em>
           like circles. This is becasue a browser sees a webpage 
           as a series of boxes, nested inside of one another. When reading an 
           HTML document as text, you can see a wave of changing
           indentations running along the left side. These indentations
           indicate how deeply the element's corresponding "box" is nested 
           inside of the entire structure. This structure not only organizes 
           all the elements within a page but it also makes the code 
           easier to read. It also allows developers to easily 
           re-arrange elements on the page.

         <p>
           CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Like HTML, 
           it is also a language and it controls the look, 
           or style, of a webpage. One HTML file can reference 
           just one, or several CSS files in order to create the
           final, visible look, or style, of the page. You can 
           think of CSS as a set of rules that tell the browser 
           how to display certain elements. CSS allows programmers 
           to group similar elements together by giving them 
           the same class name and then specifying a style that 
           should apply to all the elements with that same class 
           name.

           Think of it in terms of laws, there are national laws,
           state laws, municipality laws and maybe even your own
           house rules.  In CSS you can write rules that apply to 
           the entire page, or just to one section, or just one 
           box, or just one element. However, in CSS, the most 
           specific rule is applied to every element, hence the
           word Cascading.The browser goes deeper and deeper 
           into the set of rules to find the one that best 
           describes the elements, and then applies that rule. 
           This idea is known as inheritance.

        Inheritance
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           Inheritance is a feature of CSS that helps developers 
           avoid repetition. It relies on the tree-like, or 
           nesting-box structure of HTML to operate. This 
           structure creates an ancestor-descendant relationship 
           in the elements and is what allows properties to be 
           applied not only to a specified element, but also to 
           its descendants. This means that descendant elements 
           may inherit properties from any ancestor elements 
           enclosing them. Inheritance is what prevents 
           developers from having to declare certain properties 
           over and over again.

         <p>
           Avoiding repetition when writing code is important 
           for several reasons. 
         </p>
         <p>
           One, it helps prevent errors. When programmers don’t 
           avoid repetition it leads to having to repeat the same, 
           or just slightly different, code over and over again 
           in many HTML elements. This leads to errors when a 
           programmer needs to make changes to something. 
           If they don’t meticulously make the same changes 
           everywhere the repeated code appears, 
           problems will arise.  
         </p>
         <p>
           Two, it provides consistency. Take this webpage for 
           example. Each lesson looks the same. By giving each 
           lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same
           <span class="code">class</span>, I am able to specify
           a style for that class in only one place. Then if I 
           need to make changes, I can go back into the style 
           rule for that class and easily revise it any way I 
           want; I do not have to search the entire document 
           for each instance of that code.

         </p>
         <p>
           The value of a variable does not have to be permanent. It can be changed by creating a second assignment statement where a new value is assigned to the already existing variable. When that variable is used again, it will refer to the new value.

           Strings are a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. To allow for quotes to be used inside of strings, Python accepts either single, double or triple quotes around a string.

           The multiplication

           however can be used with a number and a string.

           A function, aka procedure, takes data as input, does somethings to that data (as defined by the function), and then produces an output. Python has built-in functions, like the <span class="code">.find</span> function but it also allows the user to create functions.
         </p>
         <p>
           Functions help programmers avoid repitition. Functions are tools that once created, can be reused forever. In other words, once a  function has been defined, it never has to be defined again.

       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           Functions are made by starting with the line of code <span class="code">def</span> and then giving a function name followed by the function's <b>parameters</b> in parantheses, followed by a semi-colon. These parameters will be replaced with values once the functions is used (called). 
         </p>
         <p>
           After the semi-colon is the "body" of the function. The body is what contains the code that specifies what to do with the input parameters. For example, the following code could be a definition of a function called 
           <span class="code">sum</span>:
           <div class="code-block">
             def sum(a,b): <br>

         <p>
           Decisions allow us to make code behave differently depending on the different values that we input. To make a decision, we first have to make a comparison so that we have a way to test and decide what to do. 
         </p>
         <p>
           There are many operators that are used for comparison. Examples include:
           <ul>
             <li> Equlality comparison:
               <span class="code">==</span>

             <li> Not equal to:
               <span class="code">!=</span>
             </li>
             <li> Greater than:
               <span class="code">></span>
             </li>
             <li> Less than:
               <span class="code"><</span>
             </li>
             <li> Greater than or equal to:
               <span class="code">>=</span>

               <span class="code"><=</span>
             </li>
           </ul>
           The output of a comparison is a Boolean value. It is either true, or false.

           If statements help us make decisions by  making the code behave differently depending on the result of the comparison. They are written in the following form:

           The <span class="code"> < block > </span>

         </p>
         <p>
           It is important to note the indentation of the 
           <span class="code"> < block > </span>. It shows us that it is <em>inside</em> of the if statement, and also where it ends. If the next statement is not indented, it will execute regardless of what the test expression evaluates to becasue it is not inside of the if statement's
           <span class="code"> < block > </span>.

           Therefore, if the first expression evaluates to true, the output value is true and the second expresion is not evaluated. If the first expression evaluates to false, the output value is the value of the second expression.

           A function where the output is the biggest of the three numerical inputs:
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           def biggest(a,b,c): <br>
           <span class="indent-1">if a > b:</span><br>
           <span class="indent-2">if a > c:</span><br>
           <span class="indent-3">return a</span><br>
           <span class="indent-2">else:</span><br>
           <span class="indent-3">return c</span><br>
           <span class="indent-1">else:</span><br>
           <span class="indent-2">if b > c:</span><br>

           <span class="indent-3">return c</span><br>
         </div>
         <p>
           This problem can be solved much easier if we use the previoulsy defined function bigger(a,b):
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           def bigger(a,b):<br>
           <span class="indent-1">if a > b:</span><br>
           <span class="indent-2">return a</span><br>
           <span class="indent-1">else:</span><br>
           <span class="indent-2">return b</span><br>
         </div>
         <p>
           That solution looks like this:
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           def biggest(a,b,c):<br>
           <span class="indent-1">
             return bigger(bigger(a,b),c)
           </span><br>
         </div>
         <p>
           Here, two calls to the function bigger are used to produce the output of the function biggest. The word bigger following the keyword <span class="code">return</span> represents the second call to the operation bigger, while the word bigger inside of the parentheses represents the first call where the bigger of variable a and b is determined. The second call then compares the output of the first call with the last variable c to determine the biggest of those two.

         Loops

       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           A loop is a block of code, preceded by the keyword <span class="code">while</span>, that repeats as long as the test expression following <span class="code">while</span> evaluates to true. If the test expression evaluates to false, python moves on to the next instruction. In other words, as long as the test expression evaluates to true, the code in the body block of <span class="code">while</span> will execute over and over again. If it evalutes to false, the code in the body is not executed and we move on to the next instruction. Here is an example of a loop structure:
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           i = 0<br>
           while i < 10: <br>
           <span class="indent-1">print i</span><br>   <span class="indent-1">i = i + 1</span><br>
         </div>
         <p>
           The result will print out the numbers from 0-9. Once we print 9, the value of i changes to 10 and then when we evaluate the test expression, it evaluates to false so the loop stops.

         Break Statements
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           Break statements provide a way to stop a loop even while the test expression is  true. That structure looks like this:
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           while < test expression >:<br>
           <span class="indent-2"> < block> </span><br>
           <span class="indent-2">
             if < break test >:<br>
             <span class="indent-3">break</span><br>
             <span class="indent-2"> < block  > </span><br>
           </span><br>
         </div>
         <p>
           If the test expression evaluates to true, python evaluates the code inside the block. If the break test is false, python contines with the code in the block. Then python goes back to the test expression, if it evaluates to true it runs the code in the block. Python will repeat this cycle until the output of the break test is false. If this happens, instead of running the rest of the code in the block, python jumps out of the loop and continues with the next instruction.

         <p>
           Structured data is data that can be broken down into its individual elements and where we can perform operations on those elements. Examples include:
         </p>
         <p>
           Strings, a sequence of characters. We can operate on sub-sequences of strings. For example: If we assign the variable s to the string ‘yabba!’, we can select an element of this string by indexing a certain position in the string using square brackets. Because we can access specific characters in a string, a string is an example of structured data. 
         </p>
         <p>
           Lists, a sequence of any element, allow us to reference any element(s) in the list and perform operations on it/them.

         Lists
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           Lists are a sequence of any elements. There are no restrictions on the types of elements that can be put in a list. They can also contain more than one type of element. Here is an example of a list, which contains multiple types of elements. This list contains strings, numbers and even other lists. 
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           mixed_up = [‘apple’, 3, ‘oranges’, 27,  [1, 2, [‘alpha’, ‘beta’ ]]]
         </div>
         <p>
           Lists allow us to nest lists inside of other lists. The last element in the list mixed_up is a list, containing another list. For lists that don’t fit on one line: create a new line after a comma, and indent it to let Python know that the elements on the second line are still part of the list.
         </p>
         <p>
           We can access elements in a list the same way we index strings. If a list contains other lists, like the example below, we can access these nested elements by using the square brackets twice.
         </p>

         Mutation

       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           Mutation means we can change the value of a list after we have created it. While lists do support mutation, it is extremely important to remember that strings do not. When we assign a variable to a string, we can
           change the value of the variable by making a second assignment statement and assigning that existing variable to a new string. It is important to note that the value of the variable is changing, not the value of the string itself. <br>
           <br>
           When we mutate a list, we are changing the value of the list.
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           p = [‘H’, ‘e’, ‘l’, ‘l’, ‘o’]<br>
           p[o] = ‘Y’<br>
           print p <br>
           >>> [‘Y’, ‘e’, ‘l’, ‘l’, ‘o’]
         </div>
         <p>
           In the first statement we assigned the variable p to a list containing some single character strings. The second assignment statement finds the position indicated on the left side p[0], and replaces it with the value on the right side, ‘Y’. Note, we did not create a new list, we changed the value of the existing list.

         Aliasing
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           The term aliasing is used when there are two different ways to refer to the same object. What happens when we add the following assignment statements to the example above?
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           q = p<br>
           q[4] = '!'<br>
           <br>
           print q<br>
           >>> ['Y', 'e', 'l', 'l', '!']<br>
           print p<br>
           >>> ['Y', 'e', 'l', 'l', '!']
         </div>
         <p>
           The first statement introduces another variable, q, which also refers to the same list object that the variable p refers to. This is an example of aliasing; we have two variable names that refer to the same object. The second assignment statement shows why mutability is both powerful and tricky. Because two variables, p and q, now refer to the same object, mutating an element in variable q also changes the value of p. It is important to keep track of which variables refer to which object so that we don’t run into any problems when we make changes to any of those variables.

         List Operations
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           <b>Append</b> is a built in method of Python that will add a new element to the end of a list.  Append mutates the list. For example:
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           stooges = [‘Moe’, ‘Larry’, ‘Curly’]<br>
           stooges.append(‘Shemp’)<br>
           print stooges<br>
           >>> [‘Moe’,  ‘Larry’,  ‘Curly’, ‘Shemp’]
         </div>
         <p>
           The <b><span class="code">+</span> Operator</b> behaves very similarly to the concatenation operation for strings. The <span class="code">+</span> operator doesn’t mutate the list, it creates a new list. For example:
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           [0,1] + [2,3]<br>
           >>> [0,1,2,3]
         </div>
         <p>
           The <b>len operator </b> (short for length) outputs the number of elements in the input. The len operator only counts the outer elements of a list. If one of the elements in the list being counted is a list, len will not count the elements within this list, only the list itself is counted as an element in the outer list. For example:
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           len( [‘a’, [‘b’, [‘c’]]] )<br>
           >>> 2

         Loops on Lists
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           If we want to loop through the elements in a list, we can do so by using either a while loop or a for loop. The for loop provides a simpler way (less code to write) of doing this than the while loop. For loops take the following structure:
         </p>
         <div class="code-block">
           for  < name >  in < list >:<br>
           <span class="indent-1"> < block > </span>
         </div>
         <p>
           A for loop loops through a list in order and each time it assigns the name to one element in the list and evaluates the block. It does this until each element in the list has been looped through. A for loop makes defining the following function very easy.

           Index is a method in Python that allows us to easily find where a particular value in a list first appears. If the value is not found, it produces an error.

           <span class="code">not</span>, giving the reverse meaning.
